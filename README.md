# Sparse Matrices

The motivation behind this project is to understand the fundamentals behind the time and space complexity of algebraic routines on sparse matrices, given different conditions. A major part of this project is understanding the im- portance of preconditioning, where the use of different preconditioners, which are the different sparse matrix representations; as well as multi-threading and parallelism, can lead to a significant reduction routine computation times.

Information regarding OpenMP multi-threading and the different sparse matrix representations have been covered in detail in the report.
